# :wave: Hey, I'm Anders!

I'm a software engineer focusing on the modern web and full-stack JavaScript. I love open source - follow or sponsor me! Currently I work as a Lead Engineer on Target.com. Degreed in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota. Have a project? I'd love to work with you! Freelance or contract, remote & off-hours, < 10-20 hours/week. [Please drop me a line](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTn7tINVqOEYdRcEj_HQGpJAL1i4mFIqrXRaBtIHjMcCEKtQ/viewform)!

I dream up ways to improve code quality and developer experience. I love to automate these with custom linter plugins, code mods, and other scripts. Here are some of my favorite tools in my dev stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, MongoDB, etc.
